## Overview

### 1. Linux

Linux is a [UNIX-like](https://github.com/sirredbeard/Awesome-UNIX#frequently-asked-questions) [open-source](https://opensource.org/osd) operating system. The core of Linux is a [kernel](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/31632/what-is-the-linux-kernel-and-what-does-it-do) developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds). Linux also includes a wide array of applications built on top of the kernel, including [web servers](https://www.linux.com/learn/apache-ubuntu-linux-beginners), [compilers](https://gcc.gnu.org), and [e-mail clients](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Geary), developed and contributed to the Linux ecosystem by a worldwide community of programmers. These applications are then assembled together into Linux [distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) by [companies](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux), [communities](https://www.archlinux.org), and [individuals](http://www.slackware.com).

### 2. Linux Distributions

Unlike Windows or macOS there are many different Linux distributions, each of which is assembled with different approaches to the software selection and implementation. For example, the goal of the non-profit volunteer [Debian Project](https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution) community is to produce a universal free operating system, while the goal of the for-profit SUSE is to provide a [stable enterprise platform](https://www.suse.com). There are also Linux distributions based on other distributions. [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) is a distribution based on Debian built by the company Canonical. Kali is a distribution based on Debian built with an emphasis on tools for network security testing. You can see the most popular distributions ranked at [DistroWatch](https://distrowatch.com).

### 3. Windows

[Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) is a family of proprietary operating systems, all of which are developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. Currently Windows 10 is Microsoft's flagship operating system. Windows 10 is available for Intel x86-based and arm64-based PCs. The Windows Subsystem for Linux first shipped in [Windows 10 Anniversary Update](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/2016/07/08/bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows-10-anniversary-update/), version number 1607, in August 2016. WSL can be enabled for free on all versions of Windows 10 after 1607, including Home, Professional, Enterprise, Server, LTSB, and Education. Originally only available for Intel x86-based PCs, Ubuntu 18.04 for arm64 was made available on the Microsoft store in [May 2018](https://twitter.com/TheRealHariP/status/994293523514970112).

### 4. WSL1

The original WSL is now known as WSL1. WSL1 is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables (ELF) natively on Windows 10. No re-compilation or 'porting' of applications is required. WSL1 provides a Linux-compatible kernel interface developed by Microsoft that allows a user to choose a Linux distribution to install from the Microsoft Store. WSL1 executes unmodified Linux ELF64 binaries by operating a Linux kernel interface on top of the Windows kernel in Windows 10. The WSL1 interface translates Linux system calls from the binaries into Windows system calls and then executes them at native speed. Linux applications run within the Linux distribution which provides the application's dependencies and package management in a container-like environment. WSL provides an interface to mount drives within WSL.

### 5. WSL2

WSL2 was announced at Microsoft Build 2019. WSL2 features a Linux kernel running inside Windows 10 and is built on the core technology of Hyper-V to provide better Linux application support and improved file performance. Transitioning to WSL2 is seamless. WSL2 is still in active development and is only available in [Insider builds](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/getting-started/). These builds are not suitable for production devices and are not recommended for a user's primary machine. Instead, users [can try WSL2 using Hyper-V](https://boxofcables.dev/trying-wsl2-on-hyper-v/) or on a secondary machine.

- [The new Windows subsystem for Linux architecture: a deep dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwhMThePdIo) - WSL2 presentation at Microsoft Build 2019
- [WSL2-Linux-Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel) - The source for the Linux kernel used in Windows Subsystem for Linux 2. 

### 6. Emulation

Windows Subsystem for Linux is not an emulator or virtualizer like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org). WSL1 is closer in its approach to [Wine](https://www.winehq.org) which is a compatibility layer to run Windows binaries on Linux by re-implementing Windows system and API calls in libraries.

### 9. Use Cases

WSL is undoubtedly a tool for power-users, developers, and *NIX/Linux geeks who want to run Windows. Most of the things you can do with WSL are going to be related to programming, the console, sysadmin, automation, AI/data science, and other geeky things.

### 10. GUI Apps

Yes, a [suprising number](https://github.com/ethanhs/WSL-Programs) of Linux GUI apps can run on WSL even though this is not officially supported by Microsoft. Running a GUI app on Linux though means running an X server on Windows. This must be downloaded, installed, and running for your GUI app to open from WSL. Otherwise it will complain of not finding a display. X servers for Windows include [X410](https://afflnk.microsoft.com/c/1291904/433017/7593?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fp%2Fx410%2F9nlp712zmn9q) ðŸ’° ($5 but very highly recommended), [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/), [GWSL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NL6KD1H33V3), or [Xming](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/) on Windows 10.

#### Web Development on WSL

Because WSL allows developers to run a variety of Linux server applications locally on their Windows machine, WSL is uniquely useful for web, cloud, and other server-side development tasks. The following are different developers' approaches to creating their web development environment using WSL and instructions on how to do the same:
